            <h1>Terms and Conditions of Service</h1>
            <h2>"Acceptance of Terms"</h2>
            <p>In order to have an access to all the services of ElTrade Group at eltradegroup.com web site, you are to accept the following terms and conditions, as well as all respective changes or modifications to them. In case you do not accept these Terms or Privacy Policy, you will not have an access to the ElTrade Group website or services.</p>
            <br>
            <br>
            <h2>"Privacy Policy"</h2>
            <p>In order to control network traffic and search for unsolicited attempts to upload or change information, or otherwise cause damage the host computer system employs software programs. All this is done for site security purposes and to make sure that the site services are accessible to all users round the clock. If such a control hunts out evidence of possible abuse or criminal activity, then the case may be taken to court. All the unsolicited attempts to upload or change information on this server are strictly prohibited and may bring judicial proceedings against it under the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act of 1986 and the National Information Infrastructure Protection Act or other law.</p>
            <br>
            <br>
            <h2>"Acceptable Use and Conduct"</h2>
            <p>All your information related to the Service is on your own responsibility and conduct. You are solely liable for ElTrade Group and its supplier’s indemnification, defence. You agree to hold harmless from any and all loss, cost, liability, and expense that can arise from or related to your data, your use of the Service, or your violation of these terms.</p>
            <p>The Software and Service are made available to you, your company, and/or your customers only for personal or commercial use. The usage must comply with all applicable laws, rules and regulations and must not cause damage to third party rights.</p>
            <p>Any irregular usage of any Wildbit Service is a breach of this Agreement and certain federal and state laws. Such breaches may bring the unsolicited user and his or her agents to civil and criminal penalties.</p>
            <br>
            <br>
            <h2>"Appropriate Email Practices"</h2>
            <p>An Unsubscribe link must be added to every email sent using Service in order to allow the subscriber to opt-out of receiving further emails. Such a link is required to be available to the subscriber for at least thirty days. You agree to keep available the unsubscribe link from any and all emails sent.</p>
            <p>All email lists contained and sent to using Service must be permission-based subscriptions. The usage of a list that has been purchased, rented or from a third-party is strictly prohibited.</p>
            <p>The unsubscribe requests for Your list that are beyond of ElTrade Group competence are monitored on your own responsibility. Unauthorised emails will meet abuse complaints and will be reflected on Your account. Maintaining abuse results lower than the industry standard is also on your duty. It is at ElTradeGroup's sole discretion to determine if abuse complaints are in excess of industry standards.</p>
            <p>ElTrade Group keeps the right to restrict any account that it finds in breach of its Terms of Use by receiving abuse complaints higher than allowed, without refund.</p>
            <br>
            <br>

            <p>1. Each email sent must contain single-click unsubscribe link that is easily available. It is allowed by ElTrade Group to choose the location of the link (either on top or bottom of campaign), but it is not possible to send a campaign without a link.</p>
            <p>2. Non-internet contact information must be included in each email. This can be a physical business address and/or telephone number.</p>
            <br>
            <br>
            <h2>"Warranties and Representations"</h2>
