		<h2>Your Personal Computer</h2>
		<p>As practice shows, Personal Computer is a major originator for stovepiping. That’s why it is crucial to search your computer activity and place greater focus on Personal Computer security. Even a brief outline of this case discovers the significance of the problem. So, please, do the utmost in order to protect your Personal Computer with the data on it.</p>
		<p>We do believe that experts such as Symantec, McAfee, Kaspersky and some others at a minimum price can provide its users with top-class anti-virus, anti-malware and personal firewall software packages. Speaking about free security variants, though there are quite good ones, anyway, you’d better choose to spend a small amount now, then count losses.</p>
		<br>
		<h2>Surfing the Internet</h2>
		<p>It goes without saying that the choice of Internet browser is absolutely your prerogative. But as a part of security recommendations, we advise you usage of Chrome and FireFox. Besides, while choosing any of the browsers pay attention to updating your software. The updates usually fix the weak spots of previous versions.</p>
		<br>
		<h2>Use Different Passwords</h2>
		<p>Living in a modern world leads us to having a lot of accounts in all spheres of our life. One more recommendation to this point is creating different and complicated passwords to any of your accounts. It’s highly important in case of protecting your personal information and identity on the whole. Modern technology in the form of password storing software packages and various devices are of great help today. But even if you use a sheet of paper for this matter, make sure it is available only to you.</p>
